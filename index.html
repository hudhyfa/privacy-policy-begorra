        <h1>Privacy Policy for Begorra GPS App</h1>

        <p>Begorra Infrastructure and Developers Pvt Ltd ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Begorra GPS mobile application ("App"). This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the personal data of users ("you" or "your") when using the App, which is intended for internal use by employees of Begorra Infrastructure and Developers Pvt Ltd.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>When using the App, we collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect your GPS location to enable the App’s core functionality. This allows you to capture and tag images of construction sites with precise location data. The location data is used to identify the exact location of the site where the image was captured and is sent to the admin dashboard for internal use.</li>

            <li><strong>Images:</strong> The App allows you to take and upload images of construction sites. Each image is tagged with the location address, user name, construction site name, date, and time. This information is collected for internal reporting and project management purposes and is sent to our admin dashboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Data Usage</h2>

        <p>The data we collect (location, images, and associated metadata such as user name, construction site name, date, and time) is solely used to enable the App’s core functionality, which involves documenting construction progress and ensuring accurate reporting within the company.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Data Sharing</h2>

        <p>We do not share any personal information, including your location data, images, or other metadata, with any third parties. The data is used only for internal purposes by Begorra Infrastructure and Developers Pvt Ltd. Users may choose to share images manually, but the App does not automatically share data with third parties.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">User Control</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Permissions:</strong> You can control the collection of your location data by disabling location permissions in your device settings. However, doing so may limit the core functionality of the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Image Management:</strong> Once uploaded, images cannot be deleted from the App by users. Images are stored and sent to the admin dashboard for internal use. Users can manually share images outside of the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Security</h2>

        <p>We take reasonable measures to secure your personal data. However, no security system is entirely foolproof. We recommend using the App in a secure environment to minimize potential risks.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>The Begorra GPS App does not use any third-party services or tools that collect user data.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Applicability</h2>

        <p>This privacy policy applies exclusively to the use of the Begorra GPS App by employees of Begorra Infrastructure and Developers Pvt Ltd.</p>
